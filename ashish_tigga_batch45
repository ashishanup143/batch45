    2.  when  i deleted voting pod within a second new pod created with different id & on gui no impact.
    
    3.  no changes in gui after worker pod delete. in cli new worker pod created with new id.
    
    4.  after deleting db node after some time new pod created with new id. in gui voting result reset to its initial output value then in voting window once i clicked to any 1 option in voting result window value got updated as present option clicked.
    
    10.  for working result pod fine  i scale out result pod  to 3 ( kubectl scale deploy result --replicas=3). now no delay observed now and every time from those 3 replica pod one is assigned to voting pod.
